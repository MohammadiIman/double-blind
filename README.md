# Computer science conferences - double-blind status

This document tracks the status of major computer science conferences
(currently defined as those listed in http://csrankings.org) with
respect to how they maintain anonymity during the reviewing process.

For the purposes of this document:

* _Single-blind_ means that author identities and affiliations are visible
to reviewers at all points during the reviewing process.

* _At least partially double-blind_ means that author identities and
affiliations are not revealed for papers prior to the submission of
initial paper reviews.

* _Double-blind to accept_ means full double-blind reviewing, that is,
where author identities and affiliations are not revealed before the
conclusion of the PC meeting, and only for accepted papers (including
conditionally-accepted papers, pending modifications due to
shepherding). In cases where the CFP does not explicitly state the use
of double-blind to accept, this status has been verified personally
with the program chair(s).
