# Computer science conferences that employ full double-blind reviewing

This document lists computer science conferences that employ full
double-blind reviewing, that is, where author identities and
affiliations are not revealed before the conclusion of the PC meeting,
and only for accepted papers (including conditionally-accepted papers,
pending modifications due to shepherding). In cases where the CFP does
not explicitly state the use of double-blind to accept, this status
has been verified personally with the program chair(s).
