# Computer Science Conferences: Double-blind Status

This document provides a curated overview of the anonymity policies of major computer science conferences (as defined by [CSRankings](http://csrankings.org)). It is maintained by [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com).

The following terms are used:

- **Single-blind**: Author identities and affiliations are visible to reviewers at all stages.
- **At least partially double-blind**: Author identities and affiliations are concealed during the initial review process.
- **Fully double-blind (blind to accept)**: Reviewer anonymity is maintained until the Program Committee meeting concludes, with identities disclosed only for accepted (or conditionally accepted) papers. For conferences that do not explicitly state this in their CFP, the policy has been confirmed directly with the program chairs.

Below is a table summarizing the status for each conference:

| Conference                | At least partially double-blind? | Fully double-blind (blind to accept)? | CFP or Similar Link |
