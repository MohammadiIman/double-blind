# Computer science conferences - double-blind status

This document lists computer science conferences and their status
with respect to anonymity during the reviewing process.

* "Partial double-blind" means that author identities and affiliations
are revealed for all papers prior to the final decision, but not until
after the submission of paper reviews.

* "Double-blind to accept" means full double-blind reviewing, that is,
where author identities and affiliations are not revealed before the
conclusion of the PC meeting, and only for accepted papers (including
conditionally-accepted papers, pending modifications due to
shepherding). In cases where the CFP does not explicitly state the use
of double-blind to accept, this status has been verified personally
with the program chair(s).
