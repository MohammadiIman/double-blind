# Computer Science Conferences – Double-blind Status

This document provides an up-to-date overview of the reviewing practices of major computer science conferences (as defined by [CSRankings](http://csrankings.org)). It is curated by [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com).

For the purposes of this document:

* _Single-blind_ means that author identities and affiliations are visible
to reviewers at all stages during the reviewing process.

* _At least partially double-blind_ means that author identities and
affiliations are hidden during the initial paper review phase.

* _Double-blind to accept_ means full double-blind reviewing, that is,
where author identities and affiliations remain hidden until after
the Program Committee meeting, with identities revealed only for
accepted (or conditionally accepted) papers.
When the CFP does not explicitly mention full double-blind reviewing,
this status has been verified directly with the program chair(s).

Below is a summary table of the current status for each conference:
